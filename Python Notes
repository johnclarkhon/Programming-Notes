Welcome to my Notes!!

PYTHON


Choosing the right holder:

Lists: For ordered collections of elements that need to be modified.
Tuples: For immutable collections of related data.
Dictionaries: For key-value pairs where efficient lookup is required.
Sets: For unique elements and set operations.
Custom classes: For complex data structures with specific behaviors.
